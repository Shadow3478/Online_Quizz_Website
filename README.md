## Project Structure

The website uses the following languages and technologies:
**Programming Languages:**
1. TypeScript - Main language for all the application logic and components
2. JavaScript - TypeScript compiles to JavaScript for the browser
3. HTML - Structure of the web pages (in index. html and JSX/TSX markup)
4. CSS - Styling (through Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom styles)
   
**Frontend Framework & Libraries:**
- React - JavaScript library for building the user interface
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- Wouter - Lightweight routing for navigation between pages
- Lucide React - Icon library

**Tech Stack Summary:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Routing: Wouter
- Build Tool: Vite
- UI Components: Shadcn UI (pre-built React components)

So essentially, it's a React TypeScript application styled with Tailwind CSS - a modern,
professional web development stack that's widely used in the industry today. The code is
clean, type-safe (thanks to TypeScript), and fully responsive across all devices!
